# Intended game structure: What I want to get done in week 1
## Player
A player will be an object that can move in two dimensions, and shoot bullets in two dimensions. They will have a health value with a UI indicator, perhaps a level, and I hope to load an image to represent the player. Idealy this image will transform as the player moves so they are not just a sliding image.

## Weapons
The player will be able to pick up weapons, one at a time, and these weapons will have unique damage, bullet image representations, and bullet speeds.

## Monsters
I will start with implementing a single monster type to get the game in a working condition. If I have time, I will add more. Ideally the monster will move toward the player and hurt them when they touch.

## Room
A room will be an object with a unique image that is linked to other rooms. For the sake of testing I will build the game and test with a single room, intending to add a randomly generated map of rooms in week 2.
