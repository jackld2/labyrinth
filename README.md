# LABYRINTH

Labyrinth is a randomly generated, skill based, dungeon crawling, shooting game. You are placed in a random room in a 'Labyrinth'. There are doors on all four sides of these square rooms. Be sure to pick up the weapon provided in the first room. Every weapon is randomly generated with different bullet speeds, damages, bullet sizes/hitbox sizes, and bullet limits. Bullets can be shot in all four directions and your momentum as the player is added to the bullet's trajectory. Explore the labyrinth and kill the monsters, each room may or may not spawn a weapon, and there is a small chance of a boss room spawning which is high difficulty but high reward. Press M to see where you are and how many rooms you have traveled. You will see the map can extend for hundreds of rooms (over 800) and the final room can be any one of these rooms. Actually, you can go beyond 800 rooms, you just wont apear on the map anymore (this can be fixed in the future).
