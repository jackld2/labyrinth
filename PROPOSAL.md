# Project Proposal
So I have always wanted to try my hand at procedural generation. I thought this would be a good opportunity to
explore it. Back in my very first CS class at my community college, one of the options for our final project
was a proceduraly generated and seeded tilemap of different land tiles something sort of like [this](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/79049/generating-tile-map).
